# RL Diversity with Soft-Muon

2026/5/30

## Muon diversifies input-output relationships

The 2D weights `W` in a neural network or transformer represent linear mappings from input activations to outputs. Let `G` be the estimated gradient of the loss with respect to such a weight matrix. The SVD `sum_i s_i output_i input_i^T` of a matrix `G` decomposes it into weighted input-output relationships

`s_i output_i input_i^T`

where `s_i>0` is the corresponding singular value. [Muon](https://kellerjordan.github.io/posts/muon/) approximates the transformation of the gradient `G` where all the `s_i` are scaled to the same value. We can think of this as increasing the diversity of the learning signal instead of letting it be dominated by a few relationships `output_i input_i^T` with large singular value.

## Diversity collapse in RL

In RL we only get one reward signal per reponse (or a few in the case of VPO). Therefore the estimated policy gradient may not have enough information to estimate 1000s of input-output relationships, so the Muon update becomes dominated by noise. On the other hand collapse of diversity and exploration is a well-known issue that can arise in RL finetuning of LLMs, and methods such as [vector policy optimization (VPO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22817) seek to ameliorate this.


## Soft Muon

We explore whether [Soft-Muon](https://nilin.github.io/contra-muon-and-soft-muon/) provides an alternative way to encourage diversity and exploration during RL, while being more robust to noisy policy gradients than full Muon.

## Experiment

We test Soft-Muon for RL in a setting from the [VPO paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22817). We use a 7x7 version of the Maze benchmark described in the paper. We compare AdamW GRPO baseline vs Muon GRPO vs AdamW VPO. Like the VPO paper we train on multi-answer chains: one model completion contains m=3 candidate answers (routes). We use multi-answer chains for all methods (AdamW baseline, Muon, and AdamW VPO). For the AdamW and Muon GRPO methods, each rollout is scored by the best route among the 3 following the VPO paper (probably not ideal for these methods for late training). VPO additionally receives a vector reward r(x, y) representing a decomposition of the reward into [completion, gold, diamond, avoid_lava], whereas the other methods get the averaged vector reward.

We run 50 steps and swept learning rates 1e-6, 3e-6, 1e-5 and picked 3e-6 based on mean best-route score@30 for the AdamW GRPO baseline.

Please see the full experiment settings at [this repo](https://github.com/nilin/rl-diversity).

The plot below reports mean best-route score@k for 7x7 Maze RLVR runs at learning rate 3e-6, excluding k=1. Each route gets a scalar reward from `[completion, gold, diamond, avoid_lava]`, then the evaluator takes the best route score in each k-route pool and averages those best scores.

## Discussion and related methods

[Pion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.19282) is a high-pass version of Muon which achieves the same goal of suppressing noisy small singular pairs while keeping Muon behavior for leading singular modes. The Pion paper also identifies RL as a relevant setting due to the low-signal regime. These Muon-like methods encourage diversity at the level of the optimizer and may prove to be to complimentary to methods such as [VPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22817) which modify the loss to encourage diversity.

Interestingly [PufferLib](https://puffer.ai/blog.html) found standard Muon to be a significant improvement over Adam. I think it's likely that PufferLib's classical RL setting with large numbers of rollouts makes it behave more similarly to the pre-training regime with higher signal to noise, and that this regime benefits the standard Muon which applies full strength to all singular modes.
